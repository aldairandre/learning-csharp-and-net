  C# Break
    You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement.

    The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

    This example jumps out of the loop when i is equal to 4:

*/

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  if (i == 4) 
  {
    break;
  }
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
